# Code of Conduct

Swipe for Future is a friendly place for learning and creative collaboration. Weâ€™re committed to keeping it that way.

By participating in the Swipe for Future community, you agree that you'll follow this code of conduct.

**In short: Be nice. No harassment, trolling, or spamming.**

-   **Harassment** includes sexual language and imagery, deliberate intimidation, stalking, name-calling, unwelcome attention, libel, and any malicious hacking or social engineering. Swipe for Future should be a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, national origin, or religion (or lack thereof).

-   **Trolling** includes posting inflammatory comments to provoke an emotional response or disrupt discussions.

-   **Spamming** includes posting off-topic messages to disrupt discussions or flooding discussions with files or text.

If you see someone harass, troll, or spam anywhere in the Swipe for Future community (Discord, GitHub, Instagram etc.), notify us in the Core Team, preferably with a screenshot of the offense. The Core Team will take any action we deem appropriate, up to and including banning the offender from Swipe for Future.

Inspired by the freeCodeCamp code of conduct.
